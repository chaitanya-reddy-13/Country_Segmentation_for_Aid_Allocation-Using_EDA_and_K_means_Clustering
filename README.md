# Country Segmentation for Aid Allocation

## Project Overview
This project aims to **categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors**. By performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and leveraging **K-Means Clustering**, we aim to identify groups of countries most in need of financial aid. This segmentation can help in making data-driven decisions for aid allocation.

## Objective
To segment countries into clusters based on socio-economic and health indicators, helping stakeholders identify countries that should be prioritized for financial aid.

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on socio-economic and health indicators of various countries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data to prepare it for clustering.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the K-Means algorithm to group countries into clusters.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Interpret clustering results and provide actionable insights.
